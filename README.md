# Interactive Gallery

## Objective
You will design and develop an interactive ***image*** gallery. In addition to being built dynamically with JavaScript, users should be able to reveal additional information (larger version of the image, details about the image, etc) by interacting with the gallery and images.  

For more information, refer to the [Interactive Gallery](https://imdac.github.io/mtm6302/assignments/interactive-gallery.html) assignment page.
